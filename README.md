# Sam Kavanagh's Personal Website: [Tofu.Dev](https://tofu.dev)

It might be a little overkill for a personal website, but in order to demonstrate my skills/knowledge I've utilized all the most modern technologies and design principles in the design of [tofu.dev](https://tofu.dev).

## Front-End
This project is built on the `Angular` framework. The front-end is built using `TypeScript`/`JavaScript`, as well as `Sass`/`CSS`.

Responsive design principles have been used throughout, meaning the site will look great whether viewed on desktops, mobiles, or tablets.

The site is a single-page application (SPA), meaning the entire page does not need to be reloaded when visiting different parts of the website. This provides a much smoother user experience. 

## Back-End
The content management system (CMS) `Contentful` is used to host this site's content. This allows the content to be edited, and new content added via a friendly user interface, and requires no knowledge of programming. Changes to the content via `Contentful` are reflected instantly.

The content (including this!) is written in `Markdown`, via a rich text-editing interface on `Contentful`. This `Markdown` content is then automatically converted to `HTML` and rendered as you see it here! 

## Dev-Ops
The code for this website is managed using the version control system `Git`, and is publicly viewable on `GitHub`, I have nothing to hide!

The website also supports continuous delivery via `Netlify`, this means that any updates to the code are reflected in less than a minute, and without any downtime to users!
